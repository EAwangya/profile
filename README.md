</details>

<details><summary>What are you most CONFIDENT in on your resume?, What SCALE are you most confident working at?</summary>

```What are you most confident in on your resume?```
"I'm most confident in my experience with Terraform and AWS infrastructure automation. I've used Terraform extensively to provision and manage cloud resources in production environments, including VPCs, EC2, EKS clusters, and IAM policies. I’ve built reusable modules, implemented remote state with locking, and integrated Terraform workflows into CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions. It’s an area where I’ve made a measurable impact—improving deployment speed, reducing manual errors, and enabling infrastructure consistency across teams."

``` "What scale are you most confident working at?" ```
"I'm most confident working at the mid-to-large scale—for example, environments with dozens of microservices, multiple staging/production AWS accounts, and container workloads orchestrated by Kubernetes or ECS. I've supported infrastructure that handles thousands of users and processes real-time data, and I’ve worked with security and compliance constraints like HIPAA, so I’m comfortable balancing scale with reliability and governance."

</details>

<details><summary>Tell me about a CONFLICT at work and how you dealt with it."</summary>

"Sure. One situation that comes to mind was during a project to implement infrastructure-as-code across our cloud environments. I was working closely with a developer who preferred to manage certain AWS resources manually through the console, while I was advocating for consistency and automation using Terraform.

At first, it led to tension—some resources were being changed out-of-band, which caused drift and broke our CI/CD workflows. Instead of escalating, I scheduled a one-on-one conversation to understand his perspective. It turned out he wasn’t against automation—he just hadn’t used Terraform much and was under pressure to meet a short deadline.

I offered to pair with him and walk through writing the Terraform for his use case. That not only helped get his part of the infrastructure into code, but also gave him confidence to use it going forward.

In the end, we aligned on a process that allowed faster manual testing in non-prod, but required Terraform for anything going to production. It strengthened both our working relationship and our platform reliability."

</details>

<details><summary>Describe something you're really PROUD of.</summary>

"One project I’m really proud of was when I led the effort to refactor and modernize our infrastructure provisioning process using Terraform and GitHub Actions.

Previously, the team was relying on manual AWS console changes and scattered scripts, which made our environments inconsistent and hard to track. I proposed a Terraform-based approach, created reusable modules for common resources, and integrated automated validation and plan-review steps into our CI/CD pipeline.

It wasn’t just a technical win—it also required getting buy-in from teammates, documenting workflows, and training others on the new process. In the end, it improved our deployment speed, auditability, and team confidence, especially when provisioning HIPAA-sensitive environments.

What made me especially proud was seeing other teams adopt the same approach after we rolled it out, and hearing feedback that it reduced friction and increased reliability.

</details>

<details><summary>What’s most important in a TEAM for you?</summary>

"For me, the most important things in a team are trust, collaboration, and shared ownership.

I value working with people who are open to sharing knowledge and giving constructive feedback—especially in fast-moving environments like those involving Kubernetes and cloud infrastructure. No one knows everything, so it’s important that we feel safe asking questions or challenging ideas.

I also appreciate when everyone takes responsibility not just for their own work, but for the success of the system as a whole. Whether it’s a deployment going sideways or troubleshooting a tricky bug, it’s motivating to be in a team where people jump in and support each other.

And lastly, clear communication—whether it’s standups, pull requests, or incident response—is key. When we can openly talk through problems and iterate together, the team and the platform both get stronger."

</details>

<details><summary>Time you've used LOGS or MONITORING tools to solve a hard problem.</summary>


Sure. In one situation, we had a production issue where an API was intermittently timing out, but only for some users and only at peak hours. The application logs weren’t showing any errors, and the service appeared healthy in our basic uptime checks.

I turned to CloudWatch Logs Insights and started by filtering logs by response time and correlating slow responses with specific endpoints. Using custom metrics, I noticed that timeouts were happening mostly on one route that accessed a downstream PostgreSQL database.

From there, I checked Grafana dashboards, which were pulling metrics from Prometheus and RDS performance insights. I noticed a CPU spike and connection saturation around the same time as the API issues. Digging into the DB logs confirmed a connection pool exhaustion.

We realized the Kubernetes pods were scaled up, but the database connection pool settings hadn’t been adjusted accordingly—causing throttling at the DB layer.

We tuned the connection pool size, adjusted our scaling policy, and added alerts via CloudWatch Alarms and Slack notifications for high DB CPU and connection usage. After that, the issue was resolved and didn’t recur.

This case really highlighted the value of correlating application logs with infrastructure monitoring, and having end-to-end visibility across services.


</details>

<details><summary>An example of when you've used GREP for a complicated search</summary>

In one case, I had to debug a production issue where a Kubernetes pod was intermittently failing to authenticate with a backend service. The logs were massive—gigabytes of mixed stdout and error output across dozens of files.

I used a grep pipeline to isolate error entries that included timestamps, the keyword AuthError, and only those that occurred within a certain time range. Here's a simplified version of the command I used:
```
Find lines containing the word “error” in all .log files - grep "error" *.log
```
```
A More Advanced Example with Case-insensitive, recursive, with line numbers
grep -rin "timeout" /var/log/
-r: Recursively search subdirectories

-i: Case-insensitive match

-n: Show line numbers of matches

"timeout": The search pattern

/var/log/: Directory to search in
```
This helped me narrow down the issue to a very specific window where the backend service was rejecting tokens due to clock skew. I combined this with awk later to extract only the pod names and correlate with kubelet logs.

Using grep in this layered way saved me from having to load the logs into an external tool and helped identify the root cause much faster."

</details>

<details><summary>what are your favorite AWS services?y</summary>

That’s a great question. One of my favorite AWS services is Amazon ECS and EKS, because I work extensively with containerized applications. ECS is great for simpler use cases and fast deployments, while EKS gives me full Kubernetes flexibility for more complex orchestration.

I also really like AWS Lambda, especially for lightweight automation and event-driven workflows—it’s powerful for decoupling infrastructure logic from deployment code. It helps reduce overhead and simplifies things like alerts, cleanup scripts, or CI/CD hooks.

For infrastructure provisioning, CloudFormation is solid, but Terraform has been my tool of choice. I work with it on top of AWS services like VPC, EC2, S3, and RDS, and I appreciate the control and versioning it brings.

Lastly, CloudWatch is a service I rely on heavily—not just for logging and metrics, but for setting up alarms and integrating it with SNS or Lambda to respond to incidents quickly.
